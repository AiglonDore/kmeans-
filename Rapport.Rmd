\section{Regular algorithm}
Before writing the improved \(K\)-means, we just want to make a quick reminder on the regular one:
```{r kmeans, code = readLines("kmeans.R")}
```
On this base, we are now going to only rewrite the initialization of this algorithm, as the other parts remain the same in the improved one:
```{r kmeanspp, code = readLines("modified-kmeans.R")}
```
\section{Generation of test samples}
```{r samples, code = readLines("simulation.R")}
```
We are now going to use these data set to test our algorithms.
\part{Application to iris data}
```{r loadiris, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(dplyr)
```
